# connector-api-python-quickstart_4BME280
This is a quickstart application for the [mbed-connector-api-python](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-connector-api-python) package.
The goal of this application is to get the user up and running, using the mbed-connector-python package and talking to devices through mbed Device Connector in under 5 min, 5 steps or less.
The quickstart webapp is meant to be paired with the [BLEClient_mbedDevConn](https://github.com/soramame21/BLEClient_mbedDevConn) and the [BLE_Server_BME280](https://github.com/soramame21/BLE_Server_BME280). The quickstart web app will allow the user to see measured sensor value through Device Connector.

### Pre-requisites
- A [mbed connector](https://connector.mbed.com) account and have generated an [API token](https://connector.mbed.com/#accesskeys)
- A endpoint running the [mbed client quickstart example](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-quickstart)
- Install the required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Use
1. Put your [API key](https://connector.mbed.com/#accesskeys) into the app.py file, replace the following text
    ```python
    token = "Change Me" # replace with your API token
    ```
    or set an evironment variable called `ACCESS_KEY` with the value of your API key
2. Run the `app.py` file
```python
python ./app.py
```
3. Open a web page to the web.py server. Usually [//localhost:8080](//localhost:8080) will work.
4. Touch BME280 by finger to see temperature and humidity change on the web app.
5. Modify : go checkout the API for the [mbed-connector-api-python library](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-connector-api-python/en/latest/) and make your own applications!


## Troubleshooting
Here are some common problems and their solutions.

##### Cannot establish a secure connection
This is most likely caused by not having the `requests[security]` package installed. If you are using Ubuntu 14.4 LTS you may need to update pip first `pip install -U pip` and then install the requests security package `pip install -U requests[security]`.

##### WebSocket transport not available
Dont worry about that warning message, it is not applicable to this demo, but likewise the warning message cannot be disabled.

##### ERROR 500 on trying to run the app.py file
Make sure you added your [Access Key](https://connector.mbed.com/#accesskeys) to the app. You can do this by either changing the value of the `token` variable in the app.py file or by setting the `ACCESS_KEY` environment variable to your access key.
